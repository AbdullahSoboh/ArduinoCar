## Overview
The Arduino Car project is an autonomous vehicle capable of navigating and avoiding collisions in a controlled environment. It uses a variety of sensors to gather real-time data and make navigation decisions, achieving a 95% success rate in collision avoidance.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno/Mega
- Ultrasonic Range Finders
- Brushless DC Motors
- Assorted Resistors and Capacitors
- Breadboard

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Autodesk TinkerCAD (for circuit design)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
3. Compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage
1. Assemble the hardware according to the circuit diagram in the `docs` folder.
2. Power up the Arduino board.
3. Observe the car navigate autonomously, avoiding obstacles.

## Known Issues
- Limited to a controlled environment.
- Not suitable for navigation on uneven terrain.
